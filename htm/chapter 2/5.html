        Featured articles in Wikipedia

This star symbolizes the featured content on Wikipedia.
Featured articles are considered to be some of the best articles Wikipedia has to offer, as determined by Wikipedia's 
editors. They are used by editors as examples for writing other articles. Before being listed here, articles are reviewed 
as featured article candidates for accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style according to our featured article 
criteria. Many featured articles were previously good articles (which are reviewed with a less restrictive set of criteria).
 There are 6,315 featured articles out of 6,698,933 articles on the English Wikipedia (about 0.09% or one out of every 1,060 articles).
 Articles that no longer meet the criteria can be proposed for improvement or removal at featured article review.
